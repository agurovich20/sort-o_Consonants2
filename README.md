## BubbleSort
  * Best Case Scenario
     * Sorted in ascending order [1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ,5]
       * Reasoning: The lsit is already sorted so it will go through it with zero swaps
     * 
  * Worst Case Scenario
     * Sorted in descending order [5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1]
       * Reasoning: in this case Bubble sort is required to walk every large number to its correct spot.
## SelectionSort
  * Best Case Scenario
     * Sorted in ascending order [1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5]
       * Reasoning: The lsit is already sorted so it will go through it with zero swaps
     * O(0)
  * Worst Case Scenario
     * Everything in incorrect position [4 , 5 , 1 , 2 , 3]
       * while the comaprions numebr of o the all cases of the same size for Seleciton Soprt are the same, our code only switches them if it is not already in the wrong place giving this array many more switches than the best case
## InsertionSort
  * Best Case Scenario
     * Sorted in ascending order [1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ,5]
       * Reasoning: The lsit is already sorted so it will go through it with zero swaps
     * O(0)
  * Worst Case Scenario
     * Sorted in descending order [5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1]
     * O(n^2)



* Worst case scenario?
  * Bubblesort
      * sorted backwads
  * SelectionSort 
      * Everything is in incorrect position
  * InsertionSort
      * Sorted backwards
